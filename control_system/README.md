# SecondOrderSystem Class

## Overview
The **SecondOrderSystem** class is Python implementation that models second-order dynamic systems, commonly found in Control Systems. This project allows users to simulate different damping behaviors (undamped, underdamped, critically damped, overdamped) and visualize the system's poles and impulse response.

## Features
- **Supports different damping types**
- **Impulse response calculation**
- **Pole-zero plots**
- **Stability check**

## Prerequisites
To use this project, you need the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- `matplotlib` for plotting
- `numpy` for mathematical operations
